## Summary

Defines how the protocol-neutral CRUD shape in
[Data service generation for bal persist](1503_data_service.md) is rendered as an
`http:Service` when `options.dataservice.protocol = "http"`.

Each exposed entity becomes a collection resource and a key resource under the base path. The
six operations map to `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH` and `DELETE`, results are JSON, and the error
categories map to status codes.

Everything marked ✅ was compiled and run on Ballerina 2201.13.3 with `ballerina/http` 2.17.3
and a generated persist in-memory client.

## Goals

- Define the URL, method, request body, response body and status code of every operation.
- Use the persist-generated types as the request and response bodies, without wrapper types.
- Use plain REST conventions: the key in the path, `201` with `Location` on create, `PATCH`
  for a partial update.

## Non-goals

- Query options, relations and auth. They follow the roadmap in #1503.
- `PUT` as a full replace. The persist client has no replace operation.
- OpenAPI generation. It is listed under future work.
- Compatibility with the wire format of WSO2 MI data services.

## Design

### Listener and service

The generated file declares one listener and one service in the default module:

```ballerina
final Client dataserviceClient = check new ();
listener http:Listener dataserviceListener = new (dataservicePort, dataserviceListenerConfig);

service /api on dataserviceListener {
    // one group of resources per exposed entity
}
```

- **Base path:** the service's base path is `options.dataservice.basePath`, `/api` by default.
- **Shared listener:** `dataserviceListener` is a module-level listener, so user code in the
  same module can attach its own `http:Service` to it, with a different base path, and be
  served on the same port. This is the escape hatch for custom endpoints. ✅ (A GraphQL and an
  MCP service were attached to the same `http:Listener` and served alongside it.)

### Operations

For an entity `Employee` whose persist resource name is `employees`, with key `id`:

| Operation | Action | Request | Success response |
|---|---|---|---|
| Get many | `read` | `GET /api/employees` | `200`, `{"items": [Employee, ...]}` |
| Get one | `read` | `GET /api/employees/{id}` | `200`, `Employee` |
| Create one | `create` | `POST /api/employees` with an `EmployeeInsert` object | `201`, `Location: /api/employees/{id}`, the created `Employee` |
| Create many | `create` | `POST /api/employees` with an array of `EmployeeInsert` | `201`, `{"items": [Employee, ...]}` |
| Patch one | `update` | `PATCH /api/employees/{id}` with an `EmployeeUpdate` object | `200`, the updated `Employee` |
| Delete one | `delete` | `DELETE /api/employees/{id}` | `200`, the deleted `Employee` |

- **Create one and create many share one route.** The payload parameter is typed
  `EmployeeInsert|EmployeeInsert[]`; `ballerina/http` binds a JSON object to the first and an
  array to the second. ✅
- **Create many has no `Location` header**, because it creates several resources.
- **Patch is partial.** Fields left out of the body are not changed. A field set to `null`
  is set to `null` when the field is nullable.
- **Delete returns the deleted record**, as the persist client does. A client that does not
  need it can ignore the body.

#### Generated resources

```ballerina
service /api on dataserviceListener {

    resource function get employees() returns EmployeeList|DataserviceInternalError {
        Employee[]|persist:Error items = from Employee item in dataserviceClient->/employees(Employee)
            select item;
        if items is persist:Error {
            return dataserviceInternalError(items);
        }
        return {items};
    }

    resource function get employees/[int id]() returns Employee|DataserviceErrorResponse {
        Employee|persist:Error item = dataserviceClient->/employees/[id];
        if item is persist:Error {
            return dataserviceErrorResponse(item, "Employee", string `${id}`);
        }
        return item;
    }

    resource function post employees(EmployeeInsert|EmployeeInsert[] payload)
            returns EmployeeCreated|EmployeeListCreated|DataserviceErrorResponse {
        // Posts the records as an array, then reads back each created record by its returned key.
    }

    resource function patch employees/[int id](EmployeeUpdate payload)
            returns Employee|DataserviceErrorResponse { ... }

    resource function delete employees/[int id]() returns Employee|DataserviceErrorResponse { ... }
}
```

- **Return types:** get many returns only `DataserviceInternalError` on failure. Every other operation
  returns `DataserviceErrorResponse`, the union of the four error records in [Errors](#errors),
  because a write can fail with any of them.
- **Location:** a `string` key is percent-encoded as a path segment, so a key such as `P 1/a` gives
  `/api/assignments/P%201%2Fa/1`. ✅

The status code types are records that include the `ballerina/http` status code records:

```ballerina
public type EmployeeCreated record {|
    *http:Created;
    Employee body;
|};

public type EmployeeListCreated record {|
    *http:Created;
    EmployeeList body;
|};
```

#### Disabled operations

An operation whose action is not enabled is not generated. `ballerina/http` then answers on its
own:

| Situation | Response |
|---|---|
| A method that exists on no resource of the path, for example `PATCH` on a read-only entity | `405 Method Not Allowed` ✅ |
| A path that matches no resource, for example an entity that is not exposed | `404 Not Found` |

### Keys

- **Single key:** one path segment, `/employees/{id}`, typed as the key field's type.
- **Composite key:** one segment per key field, in declaration order, for example
  `/assignments/{employeeId}/{projectCode}`. ✅
- **Key types:** `int`, `string`, `float`, `decimal` and `boolean` keys bind as path
  parameters. A segment that does not convert to the key's type is answered with `400` by
  `ballerina/http`. ✅

### Types and JSON

The resources use the persist-generated types directly: `Employee` in responses,
`EmployeeInsert` and `EmployeeUpdate` in requests. The only generated types are the list
envelope and the status code records above.

| Ballerina type | JSON |
|---|---|
| `int`, `float`, `decimal` | number |
| `string`, `boolean` | string, boolean |
| `T?` | the value or `null` |
| `byte[]` | an array of numbers |
| `time:Date`, `time:TimeOfDay`, `time:Civil`, `time:Utc` | the record form, for example `{"year": 2024, "month": 1, "day": 2}` ✅ |
| enum | string |

Time values use the record form that Ballerina's JSON conversion gives the `time:*` types, so
the persist types are used without conversion code. ISO 8601 strings would need separate input
and output types for every entity with a time field, which the goals rule out for this
proposal.

### Errors

Each error category in #1503 maps to a status code. The body is the `DataserviceError` record
from `ballerina/dataservice`, with the code and message #1503 defines for the category.

| Category | Status | `code` | Raised from |
|---|---|---|---|
| Not found | `404` | `NOT_FOUND` | `persist:NotFoundError` ✅ |
| Conflict | `409` | `CONFLICT` | `persist:AlreadyExistsError` ✅ |
| Constraint violation | `409` | `CONSTRAINT_VIOLATION` | `persist:ConstraintViolationError`, raised only by an update today; see [Risks](#risks-and-assumptions) ✅ |
| Invalid input | `400` | — | `ballerina/http` payload or path binding ✅ |
| Internal | `500` | `INTERNAL` | any other error |

The status code records are generated alongside the service, so `ballerina/dataservice` does
not depend on `ballerina/http`:

```ballerina
type DataserviceNotFound record {|
    *http:NotFound;
    dataservice:DataserviceError body;
|};
```

`DataserviceConflict`, `DataserviceConstraintViolation` and `DataserviceInternalError` follow
the same form, and `DataserviceErrorResponse` is the union of the four.

Invalid input is answered by `ballerina/http` before the resource runs, so its body is the
module's default error body, not `DataserviceError`. It names every missing or mistyped field.
✅

Example responses: ✅

```
POST /api/employees  {"id":1, ...}            → 201  Location: /api/employees/1
POST /api/employees  {"id":1, ...} (again)    → 409  {"code":"CONFLICT", "message":"A record that conflicts with an existing record of the entity 'Employee' already exists."}
GET  /api/employees/99                        → 404  {"code":"NOT_FOUND", "message":"A record with the key '99' does not exist for the entity 'Employee'."}
GET  /api/employees/abc                       → 400  (ballerina/http default body)
PUT  /api/employees/2                         → 405
```

### Configuration

| Setting | Where | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Base path | `options.dataservice.basePath` | `/api` |
| Port | `dataservicePort` in `Config.toml` | `9090` |
| Other listener settings, such as TLS and timeouts | `dataserviceListenerConfig` in `Config.toml` | `ballerina/http`'s defaults |

`persist_dataservice_config.bal` declares both configurable values:

```ballerina
configurable int dataservicePort = 9090;
configurable http:ListenerConfiguration dataserviceListenerConfig = {};
```

For example, to serve over TLS:

```toml
[dataserviceListenerConfig.secureSocket.key]
certFile = "/path/to/public.crt"
keyFile = "/path/to/private.key"
```

## Alternatives

- **A separate route for create many**, such as `POST /employees/$batch`. Not needed: the
  union payload type lets one route take both, and `$` names stay reserved for query and
  metadata operations.
- **`PUT` for update.** `PUT` means full replace in HTTP, and the persist client's update is
  partial, so the method is `PATCH`.
- **`204 No Content` for delete.** Returning the deleted record matches the persist client and
  the other protocols, and costs nothing.
- **A bare array for get many.** Rejected in #1503: paging and count need room in the
  envelope.

## Testing

- Code generation: expected-output tests for single and composite keys, every action
  combination, and a custom base path.
- Behaviour, against the in-memory and H2 datastores: every row of the operations and errors
  tables, including `405` for a disabled method and `400` for a mistyped key.
- A user-written service attached to `dataserviceListener` is served on the same port.

## Risks and Assumptions

- **Two error body shapes.** Invalid-input errors use the `ballerina/http` default body, the
  others use `DataserviceError`. Aligning them needs an error interceptor on the generated
  service.
- **Time values are not ISO 8601.** Clients that expect ISO 8601 strings must convert the
  record form. Changing the wire form later is a breaking change.
- **Foreign key violations on create and delete are internal errors.** The persist SQL client
  raises `persist:ConstraintViolationError` only from an update. A create or delete that violates a
  foreign key raises a plain `persist:Error`, so the service answers `500` until the persist SQL
  client classifies those errors too. An update that violates a foreign key is answered with `409`
  and `CONSTRAINT_VIOLATION`. ✅
- **Create reads back after insert.** As in #1503, a create is not atomic with the read that
  builds its response.

## Dependencies

- [Data service generation for bal persist](1503_data_service.md)
- `ballerina/http`
- `ballerina/dataservice`, for `DataserviceError`

## Future work

- OpenAPI generation for the generated service.
- An error interceptor so invalid-input errors use `DataserviceError`.
- Query parameters for filter, sort, page and count, under the `read` action.
